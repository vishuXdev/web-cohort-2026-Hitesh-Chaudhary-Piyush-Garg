# Assignment

## Objective
This assignment focuses on understanding and practicing the various methods available for Arrays and Objects in JavaScript.

## Instructions
1. **Read**: Review the documentation on Array and Object methods in JavaScript. Make sure to understand how each method works and its use cases.
   
2. **Self-Practice**: Implement the following tasks using Array and Object methods:
   - Create an array of at least 10 elements and demonstrate the use of at least 5 different Array methods (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `find`).
   - Create an object with at least 5 properties and demonstrate the use of at least 5 different Object methods (e.g., `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, `Object.entries`, `Object.assign`, `Object.freeze`).

3. **Explore More**: Investigate additional properties and methods related to Arrays and Objects. Think about their execution and uses.

4. **Loops**: Implement examples using:
   - `for...of` loop for iterating over arrays.
   - `for...in` loop for iterating over object properties.
   - `forEach` loop for array iteration.

5. **Documentation**: Write a brief explanation of each method and loop you used, including its purpose and an example of how it works.

6. **Submission**: Once you have completed the tasks, submit your code along with the explanations in a single file.
