# Assignment: Closures, Bind, Apply, and Call

## 📚 Learning Objectives
Understand and master JavaScript's closure and function binding concepts.

---

## 📖 Topics to Study

### 1. **Closures** 🔐
- Functions that have access to variables from their outer scope
- Lexical scoping and function scope
- Practical use cases and memory implications

### 2. **Bind** 🔗
- `Function.prototype.bind()`
- Creating a new function with a fixed `this` context
- Partial function application

### 3. **Apply** 📋
- `Function.prototype.apply()`
- Calling a function with a specific `this` context
- Passing arguments as an array

### 4. **Call** 📞
- `Function.prototype.call()`
- Calling a function with a specific `this` context
- Passing arguments individually

## ✅ Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Closures 🔐
Create a function that returns a counter with increment and decrement methods using closures.

### Task 2: Bind vs Call vs Apply 🎯
Write examples comparing all three methods on a user object.

### Task 3: Real-World Problem 🚀
Build a calculator that uses `bind` to create specialized functions (add, subtract, multiply).

### Task 4: Practical Implementation 💡
Create a function that uses closures with `call`/`apply` to manage state.
