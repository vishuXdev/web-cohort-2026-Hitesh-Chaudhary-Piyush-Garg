Description

To publish the article on Hashnode (or) similar platform covering the following:

Topics to cover
What is TCP and why it is needed

Problems TCP is designed to solve

What is the TCP 3-Way Handshake

Step-by-step working of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK

How data transfer works in TCP

How TCP ensures reliability, order, and correctness

How a TCP connection is closed

Suggestions
Start by explaining what happens if data is sent without rules

Introduce TCP as a protocol that ensures reliable communication

Explain the 3-way handshake using a simple conversation analogy

Walk through each step of the handshake slowly and clearly

Explain sequence numbers and acknowledgements at a high level

Describe how TCP handles packet loss and retransmission

Explain connection termination using FIN and ACK

Keep it beginner-friendly and avoid packet-level overload

Diagram Ideas
Client ↔ Server TCP 3-way handshake flow

TCP data transfer with sequence and ACK numbers

Packet loss and retransmission flow

TCP connection lifecycle (establish → transfer → close)
