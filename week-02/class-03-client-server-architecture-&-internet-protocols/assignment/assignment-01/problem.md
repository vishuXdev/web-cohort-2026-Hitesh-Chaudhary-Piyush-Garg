When to use TCP

When to use UDP

Common real-world examples of TCP vs UDP

What is HTTP and where it fits

Relationship between TCP and HTTP

Suggestions
Start with the idea that the internet needs rules to send data

Explain TCP as safe and reliable, UDP as fast but risky

Use simple analogies (phone call vs announcement, courier vs live broadcast)

Avoid deep protocol internals - focus on behavior and use cases

Explain HTTP as an application-level protocol, not a transport one

Clarify the layering: HTTP runs on top of TCP

Explain why HTTP does not replace TCP

Address common beginner confusion: “Is HTTP the same as TCP?”

Diagram Ideas
TCP vs UDP communication flow

OSI / TCP-IP layer mapping (simplified)

HTTP request flowing over a TCP connection

Real-world use cases mapped to TCP or UDP
