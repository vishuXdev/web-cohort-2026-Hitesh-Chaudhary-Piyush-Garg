To publish the article on Hashnode (or) similar platform cover the following:

Topics to Cover
What DNS is (explained in very simple terms)

Why DNS records are needed

What an NS Record is (who is responsible for a domain)

What an A Record is (domain → IPv4 address)

What an AAAA Record is (domain → IPv6 address)

What a CNAME Record is (one name pointing to another name)

What an MX Record is (how emails find your mail server)

What a TXT Record is (extra information and verification)

How all DNS records work together for one website

Suggestions
Start with the question: “How does a browser know where a website lives?”

Explain DNS as the phonebook of the internet

Introduce one record at a time, no jumping

Use simple, real-life examples (house address, contact name, post office)

Avoid deep protocol or RFC language

Explain what problem each record solves, not just definitions

Show how a single domain uses multiple records together

Clear common beginner confusion gently:

A vs CNAME

NS vs MX

Keep language conversational and reassuring

Diagram Ideas
Browser → DNS → Server (high-level flow)

Domain name to IP mapping using A / AAAA records

CNAME pointing one domain name to another

Email routing using MX records

Simple DNS hierarchy showing NS records

One complete DNS setup for a small website
