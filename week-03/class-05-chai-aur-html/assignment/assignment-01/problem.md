Description

To publish the article on Hashnode (or a similar platform), covering the following:

Topics to Cover
What a browser actually is (beyond “it opens websites”)

Main parts of a browser (high-level overview)

User Interface: address bar, tabs, buttons

Browser Engine vs Rendering Engine (simple distinction)

Networking: how a browser fetches HTML, CSS, JS

HTML parsing and DOM creation

CSS parsing and CSSOM creation

How DOM and CSSOM come together

Layout (reflow), painting, and display

Very basic idea of parsing (using a simple math example)

Suggestions
Start with a simple question: “What happens after I type a URL and press Enter?”

Keep everything visual and story-driven, not specification-heavy

Explain the browser as a collection of components working together

Introduce terms like DOM, CSSOM, rendering engine gently

Use everyday analogies:

DOM as a tree structure

Parsing as breaking sentences into meaning

Avoid engine-specific deep dives (Chromium/Gecko only at name level)

Emphasize the flow, not memorization of parts

Reassure beginners that they don’t need to remember everything at once

Diagram Ideas
High-level browser architecture (UI, engine, networking, JS engine)

HTML → DOM creation flow

CSS → CSSOM creation flow

DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree

Render Tree → Layout (reflow) → Paint → Display

Simple parsing example (expression → tree)

Full browser flow from URL to pixels on screen
